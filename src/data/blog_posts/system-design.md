# System Design: Building Scalable Applications

Learn the principles of system design and how to architect large-scale, distributed systems that can handle millions of users.

## 1. Load Balancing

Load balancing is crucial for distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, improving responsiveness and availability.

## 2. Caching

Implementing caching mechanisms can significantly improve system performance by storing frequently accessed data in fast, easily retrievable storage.

## 3. Database Sharding

Sharding involves horizontally partitioning data across multiple databases, allowing for better scalability and performance in large-scale applications.

## Conclusion

Mastering these system design principles will enable you to build robust, scalable applications capable of handling massive user loads and complex operations.
