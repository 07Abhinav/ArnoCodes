In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the fundamental data structures that every programmer should know. From arrays and linked lists to trees and graphs, we'll cover it all.

## 1. Arrays

Arrays are the simplest and most widely used data structure. They store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing for constant-time access to any element using its index.

## 2. Linked Lists

Linked lists consist of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. They are excellent for dynamic data storage and manipulation.

## 3. Stacks and Queues

Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, while queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Both are essential for various algorithms and real-world applications.

## Conclusion

Mastering these data structures is crucial for becoming a proficient programmer. Practice implementing and using them in your projects to solidify your understanding.
